Almost 19 years ago, when the skies thundered, when the winds blew with a rage never seen before and 
when the tempest grew out of control, was born a miracle. A boy ready to take over the world, a boy that
could change the world. A LEGEND.... Okay, enough of this shit.

Hey everyone my name is Rishabh and as you would have noticed I like to potray myself in a very
heroic manner while I am just your normal guy. Hmm... wait a minute, I can't be called normal, NO, that 
would be totally wrong for I got into one of the premier institutes(Yeah right!) of my country
called IIT Roorkee and I even got into one of the most coveted groups out there! (Chapo to everyone I
know! :D). So yeah, basically I am your above-average guy and since I really can't describe each and 
every aspect of me on a webpage, come talk to me to get to know me better. I will talk to anyone 
happily.
